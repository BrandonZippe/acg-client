          <p className="text-xl text-center italic">Recreating the body style of a vintage mic combined with a proprietary dynamic capsule, the Retro 64 delivers sound that fits effortlessly into modern FOH workflows, along with a retro on-stage vibe.</p>
          <p><strong>Austin, TX – January 21, 2026 -</strong> <a href="https://warmaudio.com/">Warm Audio</a>, he best-selling manufacturer of classic-inspired professional recording gear, microphones, and guitar pedals, announces the <strong>Retro 64</strong>, a dynamic live microphone for vocals and instruments that blends unmistakable 1960s broadcast-inspired design with a custom-tuned capsule engineered for modern front-of-house environments. Designed to deliver trusted, consistent performance night after night, the Retro 64 offers the familiar sound engineers rely on, paired with standout vintage aesthetics that bring character to any stage or performance. The Retro 64 (MSRP $149 | 179 € incl. VAT | £159 incl. VAT) is available in chrome exclusively at Guitar Center and in matte black at all authorized Warm Audio retailers.</p>
          <p>“We’re excited to extend our dynamic mic lineup with this new addition. The Retro 64 was a fun project, requested by some of our key partners who wanted to see the vibe of this retro design come back to the stage. The design is a classic but we knew we wanted to deliver a modern sound so we custom-tuned a dynamic capsule purpose-built for today’s live sound environments,” said Bryce Young, President of Warm Audio. “It captures the visual vibe of a classic 1960s microphone but instantly fits into any FOH setup with clarity, consistency, and none of the squeal or harshness that plagues engineers. It’s designed to feel immediately familiar to engineers while offering performers a mic that looks as good as it sounds.”</p>
          <p>Inspired by the hammer-like durability and iconic look of a classic 1960s broadcast microphone, the Retro 64 is built for the demands of live performance. At its core is a purpose-built dynamic capsule custom-tuned for live sound, emphasizing a clear, usable upper-midrange while rolling off excess highs to reduce feedback and harshness. The result is a microphone that slots seamlessly into contemporary FOH setups, delivering excellent noise rejection, strong off-axis control, and reliable performance in loud environments.</p>
          <p>The Retro 64 is equally at home on lead and backing vocals, guitar cabinets, snare and toms, acoustic instruments, and broadcast applications. An internal shockmount helps protect the capsule from handling noise and stage abuse, ensuring consistent results on the road, from clubs to touring rigs.</p>
          <p>Like all Warm Audio products, the Retro 64 is meticulously hand-tested and inspected by trained technicians in Austin, TX, and is backed by a <strong>5-year warranty</strong>. The Retro 64 (MSRP $149 | 179 € incl. VAT | £159 incl. VAT) is available in chrome exclusively at Guitar Center and in matte black at all authorized Warm Audio retailers worldwide.
