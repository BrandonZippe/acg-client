          <p><strong>(Houston, TX -  March 18, 2024)</strong> <a href="https://rocknrollercart.com/">RockNRoller® Multi-Cart®</a>, the leading equipment utility cart brand with a patented 8-in-1 design, today announces a new worldwide licensing agreement with <a href="http://www.warmaudio.com">Warm Audio</a>, the world’s leading manufacturer of classic-inspired pro audio equipment. Per the agreement, which went into effect February 2024 with RockNRoller Multi-Cart founder Gary-Michael Dahl, Warm Audio will take control of the worldwide sales, marketing, and logistics operations of the best-selling utility cart brand.  </p>
