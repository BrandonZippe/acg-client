          <p>The current <strong>WA-47jr</strong> features a dual-backplate K47-style capsule and offers modern flexibility with three selectable polar patterns (cardioid, omni, figure-8), a -10 dB pad for capturing loud sources, and a 70 Hz high-pass filter for reducing unwanted low-frequency noise. Combining one of the most sought-after, vintage condenser capsules of all time with carefully designed contemporary circuitry, the WA-47jr delivers rich analog warmth on sources such as vocals, acoustic guitar, drums, pianos, streaming, podcasts, and more. To fit the needs of all creatives, the WA-47jr is complete with a professional shockmount, hard mount, and leather storage pouch.</p>
          <p>The new <strong>WA-47jr Studio Essential (SE)</strong> retains the same core tonal profile, using a single-backplate version of the K47-style capsule in a streamlined, fixed-cardioid design. With the same ultra-low self-noise,  wide dynamic range, and fully discrete signal path of the Jr, the WA-47jr Studio Essential delivers professional studio sound straight out of the box.
